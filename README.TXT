Pong for DOS

A very simple game of Pong, built for DOS. Move the left paddle with Q and A. Move the right paddle with ↑ and ↓.

I made this as a proof of concept for the development environment.
I used plain C and the Allegro library in an 86Box instance running Windows 98 with DJGPP as the compiler under the RHIDE IDE.
